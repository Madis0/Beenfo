Mod description
===============

Minecraft keeps honey level and bee information when you break a hive/nest, but there's no way for players to get at this information.

This mod adds both in the item tooltip

So when you're moving a nest, you can see if there's enough bees in it to start breeding at the destination, and on servers with an economy, sellers and buyers can check if the "contains 3 bees" claim is true.

Version 1.1 adds a gui to check into placed blocks as well. Right click a hive/nest to see what's inside. This requires the mod to be installed on the server and on the client.

So you can install the mod:

* on the client only: You will get the tooltip, but won't be able to look into placed hives/nests
* on the server only: Nothing bad will happen, but nothing good either. The server won't require the mod to be on the client, so people without the mod can still connect.
* on client and server/in a single player environment: You'll get the tooltip and be able to look into hive/nests.

If you're running a Spigot/Paper server, you can support players with the client-side mod as well - just throw the fabric jar file into your plugins folder. Yes, `beenfo-1.16-fabric0.13.1-1.1.jar` is a Fabric mod and a Spigot plugin at the same time, and will work with clients with the mod, no matter if they're using Forge or Fabric. For 1.16.2, use `beenfo-1.16.2-fabric0.17.2-1.1.2.jar`.
